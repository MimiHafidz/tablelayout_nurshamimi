	  They are Attacus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird and Dr. Archibald "Moonlight" Graham from Field of Dreams. They appeal to me because they embody what 
	  I strive to be. They are influential people in small towns who have a direct positive effect on those around them. I, too, plan to live in a small town 
	  after graduating from college, and that positive effect is something I must give in order to be satisfied with my life."</p>
	                   <p> "Both Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham are strong supporting characters in wonderful stories. They symbolize good, honesty, and wisdom. When
					   the story of my town is written I want to symbolize those things. The base has been formed for me to live a productive, helpful life. As 
					   an Eagle Scout I represent those things that Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham represent. In the child/adolescent world I am Mr. Finch and 
					   Dr. Graham, but soon I'll be entering the adult world, a world in which I'm not yet prepared to lead."</p>
